# YACCW

YACCW (Yet Another Collection of Commands for Windows) aims to provide self-contained Windows command-line utilites, aka the commands that only depend on built-in features available on Windows.

## System Requirements

Some scripts depend on either PowerShell Core or Windows PowerShell. Such scripts will check whether PowerShell is available.

## Installation

Most scripts are self-contained Batch scripts. Just copy whatever you want to a valid system path.
